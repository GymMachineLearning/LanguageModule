      "The subject of the video recording is squatting with a barbell and weight with poor form. There are several technical errors that occur which result in an overall lower score. The type of errors and their frequency is as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Foot Placement: The feet are not aligned with the knees, occurring 3 times. \n",

      "2. Flexibility Training: If you are struggling with maintaining a deeper squat, consider stretching and flexibility training to increase your range of motion. \n",
