      "1. **Balance and Stability**: There is a notable lack of balance and stability, resulting in stumbling or losing control of the body. This error occurred 12 times.\n",
      "2. **Form and Technique**: There are errors in the setup and technique while performing the squatting motion, which causes the athlete to be off-center and imbalanced. This results in unnecessary strain on the body and incorrect execution of the exercise. This is further evidenced by the fact that the weight pulls the athlete down and causes them to lose balance. This error occurred 8 times. \n",

      "Firstly, there are several areas where the person's knees are caving in, resulting in a 'Knee-collapse' error. These errors are noticeable from the following time intervals: 2.98 - 4.67, 7.06 - 8.7, 11.15 - 13.15, 15.71 - 17.82, and 20.22 - 22.13. It is essential to emphasize that during a squat, the knee should remain in line with the second toe to ensure proper form and to avoid injuries. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are several possible causes for these errors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lack of Core Stability: Weak core muscles can cause the knees to cave in during a squat. Strengthening the core muscles through targeted exercises can help improve stability and form. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Lack of Training: It is possible that the athlete or the person performing the exercise might be new to squatting and unfamiliar with the engagement of the proper muscles. Assigning exercises that focus on strengthening the hips, glutes, and quads could help to engage the correct muscles during a squat and potentially reduce the error. \n",

      "1. Squat Depth - This error refers to the athlete failing to reach the appropriate depth while squatting, which violates the proper form and technique required for this exercise. This error occurred repeatedly during the recording, identifying several inconsistencies in the athlete's performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. No-knee-outlet - This error refers to the athlete failing to push their knees outward during the squat, which contributes to a safer and more balanced squat form. Instead, the knees are kept straight or pushed inward, which may increase the risk of injury to the knees and hips. \n",
      "\n",
      "The causes of these errors are repeated and may be due to: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Poor flexibility - Limitations in ankle or hip flexibility can make it difficult for the athlete to achieve the desired depth while maintaining a safe and proper squat form. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Core weakness - Lack of strength and activation in the core muscles can lead to excessive lumbar curvature (rounded back) and hinders the ability to maintain an optimal posture during the squat. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Lack of training - If the athlete is relatively new to squat exercises or has not received adequate training on proper technique and form, they may need more time to improve their skill and familiarity with the movement. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. The athlete has a repetitive technical flaw termed 'Butt-wink', which involves improper movement of the butt during squatting. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. The 'Butt-wink' flaw repeatedly occurs at the following time intervals: \n",
      "   - Between 2.16 and 3.23 minutes (1 instance).\n",
      "   - Between 5.66 and 6.71 minutes (1 instance).\n",

      "   - Between 13.06 and 14.5 minutes (1 instance).\n",
      "   - Between 17.56 and 19.06 minutes (1 instance).\n",
      "   - Between 22.0 and 23.06 minutes (1 instance). \n",
      "\n",
      " 3. Due to the repetitive nature of this technical flaw, potential causes could be: \n",
      "    - Lack of proper warm-up or activation exercises focusing on the core and gluteal muscles. \n",
      "    - Misalignment of the feet or inadequate foot positioning during the squat. \n",
      "    - Weakness or lack of flexibility in the targeted muscle groups. \n",
      "    - Improper barbell grip or incorrect barbell placement on the shoulders. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. To address these issues, the athlete should focus on improving their form, strengthening and activating the appropriate muscles, and consistently practicing proper squat technique. \n",
