      " Komentarz numer: 3. Put clipper on the bars weights are wobbly\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 4. Form is fine, but that bar is HIGH. Not necessarily wrong, but certainly unorthodox.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 5. What are you even on about!! 😅 there isn’t anything wrong with your form/ technique and there’s zero butt wink. \n",
      "\n",
      "You’re likely leaning forward ever so slightly because you have the bar high, on the top of your traps. If that’s how you squat and it’s comfortable then that’s fine. But I’ll tell you now, if/ when that weight gets heavy heavy (yea I said heavy twice lol) it begins to hurt when going for 1rms etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Your stance looks quite wide though. Try and bring it in a touch and it may help with bracing and may help with you leaning forward, if you think that’s a problem. \n",

      "Your technique is perfectly fine, you silly sausage. You’re over analysing and worrying about nothing - IMO.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 6. Overall, it is a good and safe technique. That depth looks like it would get white lights in a powerlifting competition,  but if you're wanting to squat deeper or improve bottom position strength and depth for something like weightlifting (I personally also think its better to train at a slightly deeper position than you would target in competition), you might consider playing around with a narrower stance. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd also try to keep my chest up a bit more, perhaps by looking up more and imagining pointing my nipples forward like headlights. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another cue I like to enhance back tightness by engaging the lats more is to imagine bending the bar around my back. It looks to me like your back might not be as tight as it could be if you want to add stability and strength. It's a little difficult to say for sure, though, what your limiting factors are without seeing something closer to failure.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 7. Seconding this one. When the weight gets heavier, that slack in your upper back is going to fold you over. Packing your neck will help keep spinal rigidity in the upper back. \n",
      "\n",
      "[Here's a good article from Elite FTS on the topic with some cues you might find helpful.](https://www.elitefts.com/coaching-logs/neck-position-in-the-squat/)\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 9. Thanks 😅. It used to be a lot worse, I think improving my hip mobility in the time since I last squatted made a big difference. Just wanted to post and make sure it was solid, there’s just a lot more to think about for squats than any other lift. I do think the bars a little too high here even for high bar yeah.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 10. Generally the bar goes along the bottom of the traps and the tops of the shoulders. You have it on top of the traps with no shoulder support. Additionally, you have it so high, your head is rolling forward. Lower the bar, head up, chest out.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 1. Feet should remain in contact to the ground at all times and not shifting. First rep your feet shifted as you go down. Also can see them lifting a bit on each rep. Maybe some ankle mobility workout, and include ankle warm up and deep squats while holding a plate before your sets. \n",
      "\n",
      "You braced your core before first rep but I’m seeing it suddenly collapse the moment you start your rep. With lower weights try slow reps (consciously bracing throughout) with pauses during the reps. Squat university on YouTube put out great advice if you wanna check them out.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 2. try recording from a side angle next time so you can go back and watch the travel path of the bar on your ascend and descend. ideally you want that bar to travel in a straight vertical with your knees over toes , that will give you a good sense of your stability and balance on your form. i think it looks good so far tho! stay safe in there man\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 3. Pretty great, side angle would help to see more. From here I’d say make sure you’re controlling the descent especially into the very bottom and try to avoid coming up off your heels at the top\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 4. You shift a bit to the right coming out of the hole. Do you notice/feel that at all?\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 5. You anterior tilt pretty badly which means your bracing isn’t the best and you are losing a lot of power. Also means your hip flexors are taking a beating trying to stabilize so much. Your feet also come off the ground at different points on reps. Your feet’s should always remain solidly contacted to the ground. Always.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 6. Can i ask if u know anything that gets rid of muscle fatigue?\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 7. There are things to nitpick of course, but looks strong to me. Hard to see some things w. the angle, but it looks like the weight shifts to the inside of your feet potentially pronating the ankle and putting some unnecessary stress on the knee - you might play w. stance a bit to see if that helps. As Ed Coan says, you might try to \"spread your taint\" a little more and see if that helps too.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 8. I'm gonna assume tight calfs, stiff ankles like you said, and tight hamstrings. My guy needs to do some mobility stretching for sure.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 9. Yes! I think so, I sometimes feel my right hip, shifting inwards (if that makes any sense). \n",
      "\n",
      "The heel coming off is something I have to work on. Do you guys have any pre-workout strechts or any mobility advices?\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 10. On second look, your right heel comes off the ground a small bit too, which probably creates an imbalance and that shift.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 11. Someone else commented about Squat University and that is the way to go! He’ll give tons of mobility drills you can play with to figure out what’s best for you. It mostly looks like your ankle and/or hips need some extra love (just like mine) during warm up. Weighted deep squat holds or even just holding onto your rig could help.\n",

      "Currently you are starting with anterior pelvic tilt, which your body can't maintain at the bottom so your pelvis tucks under. Your spine moving like it is under load isn't great (especially with heavier loads) and is a risk for injury.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 7. I’d say buttwink is bad for your lower back but at heavier weight\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 8. That’s fine, you can say that but that doesn’t mean you are correct. You’ll need to tell that to Olympic weight lifters who have to lift to the standard of ATG on a few lifts. Many of which have butt wink and lift weight way heavier than this.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 9. They’re both right. Once you get over 3 plates this level of butt wink will 100% be detrimental to spine health. There’s no way you can say lifting heavy with compromised spinal position is fine. Widen stance and pointing toes out would likely fix this along with mobility work.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 2. That was a good Snoop Squat, because it was high as fuck\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 5. I wouldn’t make any huge form adjustments based off a 1RM attempt. You didn’t make any glaring mistakes outside of missing depth which only really matters if you want too complete. Some form breakdown during max attempts will happen. \n",

      "If you have those same problems at lower RPE sets it’s worth working on hitting depth with pin/pause squats at and making sure your hips don’t shoot up out of the hole. Strengthening your quads can help. Squat shoes are a fine thing to try like the other comment recommended.\n",

In the Sagittal (side) plane, if you widen your stance you will shorten the lever thus bringing your hips more forward at the bottom.  This will have the effect of keeping your back more upright.

      " Komentarz numer: 10. You’re low-bar squatting but with a high bar position. With the bar that high up on your shoulders you need to keep your upper body much more upright to keep your center of gravity balanced over the middle of your foot.

It would be good to get into the habit of bracing, waiting half a second, and then squatting. It's not really a big deal, and everything else looks good, though.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 2. Some of your depth issues could be caused by your narrow stance. It looks like you have pretty long femurs, which will make it much harder to squat to depth with a close stance. I would recommend moving your feet out a couple inches and also pointing your toes out more. Alternatively, invest in a pair of weightlifting shoes with a raised heel, which will generally help with depth. Otherwise, technique looks good!\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 3. I don't like comments saying \"just go deeper!\". That being said, I do feel strongly that you could benefit from some hip mobility work as it would help with depth. Personally, it made a big difference in my squat stability. The next big thing is that your arms and upper back are pretty loose and getting a little tighter would not only make you stronger but could even improve mobility. Reddit is really a mixed bag for this sort of thing so bear with us!\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 4. Cant really tell but it doesn’t look like your lats are well engaged, arms look loose. Pull the bar down into your shoulders when you brace to increase torso tightness. Either way its a technique cue to note whether you were doing it or not 🙏\n",

Technique looks mostly on point: straight back, good balance, good ankle mobility etc. But you are just a smidge high. I'd guess you're not pushing your knees out far enough for your pelvis to pass down between your thighs. You might need to point your toes out a very little bit more to allow for that motion.   \n",

I’m just basically looking for form check for everything else other than depth.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 25. But you're so close to hitting depth! Don't be so hard on yourself! I recommend doing split squat stretches. That stretch made a HUGE difference and for a while I couldn't squat without doing that stretch. Some gentle hip external rotation stretches can also feel really good\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 27. If you want your glutes working there are other exercises that are more beneficial that you will likely be able to complete a full range of motion. Squats are not glute dominant, they’re meant to develop your quadricep muscles with your glutes and hips getting some collateral stimulation - but not that great of an extent. \n",

      "I understand you are confined to what you’re able to do comfortably, but hitting depth is really the part of the movement that is the most stimulant for muscle growth, being as it stretches the muscles under load (recent research has shown that lengthening the muscles under load is better for muscle growth than just the contraction of the muscle). This is the hardest part of the movement for many, so you’ll see people not hit depth because they can’t physically lift the weight from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say you don’t *have to* squat. There are plenty of other great exercises that you may be able to do correctly that will give you the same or better results than a half squat.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 28. Solid set! I’m going to touch on two things based on what is said in your comment here and other commenters; depth and muscular engagement. As with anything, I would greatly recommend you don’t just take wholesale what anyone says on the internet, including Reddit. We’re all random strangers who may be talking out of our asses. If you want some good resources, consider looking up Jeff Nippard, Mike Isratael, or other well qualified individuals to verify or disprove what you find from Reddit/googling. \n",
      "For depth, As for depth, your depth is certainly not there. It is up to you to decide if that is important to you. Contrary to the group of people who think “ass to grass” is overrated or w/e, bear in mind that significantly more of the hypertrophic effect of most excersises (and certainly the squat) comes from the last 50% of the movement (the stretch at the bottom). The more depth you get, the deeper the stretch, the longer the eccentric, the more growth you will induce per rep. I would generally encourage anyone not squatting to at least powerlifting depth to actively work on mobility and play with form until you are at least there.\n",
      "I definitely see where the skeletal limitations within the current form are coming in. If you are interested in more depth, consider playing around with turning the feet out more and potentially widening up your legs. This is especially helpful if you want to target the glutes more, as both a wider stance and more turn out will usually shift more of the load onto the glutes.\n",
      "Contrary to what another poster said, I would recommend you keep doing back squat for glutes. With your low degree of forward knee movement, the quads won’t be engaging as much and the posterior chain will be bearing proportionally more of the load. If you are feeling a mind muscle connection with the glutes and getting a decent pump or soreness, you are most likely hitting the glutes well. Anatomically there are better movements, but if you are feeling something, I say keep with it until that goes away. \n",

There was this stigma years back in the fitness scene that you just absolutely HAD to do squats or you were missing out. That fad has come to pass, but lots of people still preach it. Squats are a great exercise, but they aren’t for everyone. I haven’t barbell squatted for probably two years. I prefer the leg press, hack squats or smith squats personally because I am more comfortable, I can safely get closer proximity to failure, and I feel it in my target muscles more than standard back squatting.\n",

      "But again, there are other variations of squats that are going to be great for you I am sure. There are also other similar versions that target the glutes more if you’re really keen on growing your butt.

Looks like a damn perfect squat, right? Now, take the ascent, reverse and double it together. https://imgur.com/a/KAVYkcz Woah! That looks weird. It looks like a deadlift because you're only hinging. You immediately shove the shins vertical so you can load the hips. The only knee travel that happens is when you're in the hole. The lockout which is all hamstrings and glutes is lightning fast.\n",

But it looks like you're trying to grow your quads, but they're too weak so they get out of the way on the ascent. Or maybe you hurt your knee at some point and this is self preservation. My recommendation is to drop the weight back 20% and spend a month or two intentionally loading the quads and keeping the knees forward on the ascent. Try to make your squat look like the \"descent double\" and add 5 pounds a workout until you're back to this weight but with your quads doing their goddam job lol. \n",

      " Komentarz numer: 73. Good question! You want to use the best form for the exercise, and for back squats, you aren't using your quads enough. So, I'd look into exercise selection rather than form. If you want to maximize booty in squats, you want to go deeper and shift pressure off the back by being more upright. The weight moves to the quads and glutes. So, I'd say front squats all the way ATG. Other exercises are better for glute hypertrophy, so I'd do front squats for strength with 3x3 or 5x3.   \n",

Telling him to drive more into the balls of his feet would help the hips firing up wards first. Secondly telling him his chest plunging into the abyss is useless info. Instead telling him to keep a neutral head position and drive his chest towards the ceiling might help him get out of loading his posterior chain in the previous position. Also passively shit talking someone because they mid/low bar is your ego talking. He asked for help on his form not someone to just spew shit at him.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 21. Most of the content online is geared towards making your squat NOT look like a good morning, so I don’t have a video. In this case, however, it could be used as a warmup tool to cue early hinging. I would just take a couple set of < 50% of your squat. Instead of dropping with your knees like you ordinarily do, bend over at the hip (hinge) just so slightly so you are in the exact position you corrected to in the video (maybe a hair more upright). Once you’re bent, drop into the squat with the knees and push out of the hole like normal. \n",

      "Since it’s unfamiliar, you might take a little bit to adapt to the new style. There’s nothing wrong with targeting a super upright squat though, so if you find that works better for you, you can start training the upper back and core to stay more upright. Front squats would be my go-to for this. With a more bent squat the way I’m suggesting, it would be more how a powerlifter would approach things, with optimizing maximum weight in mind.\n",

The balance of strength throughout the body has made my herniated and bulged disc pain disappear!  Lifts have gotten way better.  I also use a breathing belt instead of the leather bracing belt.

Your lower back is obviously stronger than your upper back right now which is why your body naturally defaults to positions where your lower back is carrying more load.

      " Komentarz numer: 9. Depth is there buddy. Tough to tell 100% with the angle but it looks like, on your first rep especially, you hinge and drop at the same time, then reach back into position to find the seat. I can tell this because your knees shoot forward as you squat. Think about hinging at your hip and then sitting back into your heels to keep that low bar bar path over the back middle part of your foot. The second rep does look better.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 30. Getting stronger faster does not mean you have to always lift heavy. In fact the opposite is true, you should not be going into the gym everyday lifting overly heavy as your muscles will not recover.

You have to let the weight sit fully on your shoulders, then pull the bar into your traps. Yes you need your hands to keep the bar in place, but really they are there to just balance it. So get  big air into your belly, pull the bar into your traps, break at the hips, drop down slowly but steady.\n",

      "\n",
      "Take a deep breath and squat. Remember you are pulling the bar down and keeping everything tight, once you get parrelell (practicing box squats with this helps), move back up. You can start releasing the breath some but not all right away. Push your knees out as you come up, squeeze your buns, and release the rest of your breath as you approach the top.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 3. Squat deeper\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 4. Work on your set up, you shouldn’t go right up to the bar and lift it up. Instead get under the bar, take a deep breath into your stomach, push your core out and then down, then lift the bar and get in position. \n",
      "Also your squat itself need some work, first off you aren’t going deep enough, work on using your legs more, right now you are mainly just bending over instead of actually going down. \n",
      "Another thing you need to work on is the speed you go, your squat is way to fast, remember it’s time under tension, try going slower on the way down, hold the position when you get to the bottom for half a second, then press it back up at a medium pace. This will help prevent injury, and it will work your muscles better, it might feel harder at first, but it will feel better as you go.\n",

      "Yours is too wide, and if you brought your feet in, you’d get a much deeper squat.

      " Komentarz numer: 41. It’s although in theory it’s worse you can go heavier which makes the hypertrophy similar + more on ur glutes/ other muscles used\n",

OP doesn’t look wildly athletic yet either… and they didn’t complain of any pain. So I don’t think they should change too much up yet. Just keep going. Just keep at it. Get some stable shoes and keep your body balanced. Slowly they will be able to get lower and try different foot stances etc etc. I felt like OP needed most to be told they were on the right track. What do I know 🤷‍♂️\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 44. You’re right. Hinging is more important with low bar squats, and when doing low bar your ankles don’t move as much so it’s a lot more hip movement. But as seen in the video, she’s doing high bar so none of that applies to her. She just needs to pick either high bar or low bar and stick with it\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 3. Mechanically you look great bro. The only thing I'd say is take that extension out of your wrists and flex the wrists forward so that they're straight and lined up with your elbow. Then pull down on the bar while you drive your upper back into the bar. This will lock the bar into position and drive more force through the bar on the way up. \n",

I don't know if for heavier loads I will keep this pattern because it stress the knees much more than what I normally do.

      " Komentarz numer: 5. Thank you\n",

Hand position is good but it may be easier if you widen your grip this will help stabilize the bar even more and less stress on the wrists. The only other thing is your decent, you start going straight down whic forces your knees foward, that is just natureal. so most of yous squat is in yur knees and quads.

See how much more upright is your upper body on the first few versus the last two where you are bent over more? Keeping your upper body upright makes your knees slide way forward out past your toes as you try to keep balanced.

As you get a bit more grindy sometimes your hips are popping up a bit first. It’s minor but more conscious and harder bracing could make later reps a bit more stable. But again, solid squats.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 3. Mostly fix your bracing, even before you unrack.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 5. Lose the pad\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 6. Watch Allan Thrall videos on squats like its a cure. Because honestly it is!\n",
      "A few big points regarding squat is: Balance, back angle and range of motion (All from the king Allan).\n",
      "Many people gave you already many many great points and i agree with most of them so I wont go in detail.\n",
      "Start your squat by breaking your hips and knees simultaneously!!!!! Do not let your hips break first and then your knees that would be one big reason people go back on their heels. - Balance. \n",
      "Back angle looks fine\n",
      "And your range of motion looks fine.\n",
      "Get rest of the info from the other comments i just said my two cents that I noticed.\n",
      "Keep it up you got this man!\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 7. A few things bud. Try either a squat shoe or converse with 5 or 10 lb plates under your heels instead of those cross trainers. Your core and upper back aren’t tight enough. Look up videos on how to brace your core properly, I recommend Alex Bromley. You arch your back hard at the start, which ruins the neutral position and stability and is probably why you have butt wink at the bottom. 🤙\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 8. From a quick observation I would recommend the following working my way top to bottom. \n",
      "\n",
      "- ditch the pad- you have a natural shelf on your traps that the bar sits nicely at. \n",
      "\n",
      "- bring in the arms in tight to stiffen up your upper back\n",
      "\n",
      "- you should record your bar path to see if you’re moving efficiently straight up and down. I don’t think you are based on this video. You may have some butt winking going on. \n",
      "\n",
      "- those shoes are terrible for squatting. You need to find a wide toe shoe that’s flat and not so much cushion. Or go barefoot if allowed at your gym\n",
      "\n",
      "- your big toe should be just outside your knee. I think your feet are more wide than they need to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "- I’m assuming you have a good breathing technique\n",
      "\n",
      "- I’m glad you’re working on squats without a belt. Keep doing that. Overtime you will build a nature belt by strengthening up your core.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 9. Pad needs to go\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 10. Look up the breathing technique for squatting. Helped me a ton in keeping good form. Large inhale, hold it in your belly (not your chest), squat, exhale when you get to the top, repeat.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 11. I like squat shoes alot. But an alternative could be converse. The soft sole cushioning isn't ideal for lifting. You want s9mething hard to push off\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 12. I guess you've looked up some tutorials on how to squat and they suggested breaking at the hips because that's what you're doing? Breaking at the hip is causing the weight to shift forward which you can see.... your weight shifts to your toes....\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to forget that cue (it's hard I know) and instead just go down and up under better balance. Not on your toes. Not on your heels. Balanced. Do some slow reps under control -- weight doesn't matter just proper balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would ignore the comments about shoes. It really doesn't matter what's on your feet. Nice lift otherwise you're strong out the bottom you have potential.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 13. Bend your knees and hips at the same time. Put your weight into your heels (echoing those that said get flatter shoes) and yes, lose the pad!\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 14. Agreed with Jaanku and VprHs try squatting without shoes, check out squatuniversity on Instagram if you use it, he’s got an encyclopedia worth of advice related to form and foot/ankle/leg mobility. Also yeah man unfortunately you must ditch the pad to learn properly. My 2c good luck!\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 15. You need some flat soled shoes because you keep leaning ever so slightly forward\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 17. Why do you keep poking your butt out before you bend your knees? A squat should be a natural movement, all one move.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 18. I think your shoes are fine and you're doing great for starting. you definitely want to start practicing bracing your core and try to bend your knees at the same time as your hips. The bar path looks pretty damn good. Starting strength, Wenning Strength and Bromley are all great sources to watch. Keep that weight move and light where you have it while you dial in your form\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 19. Try bending at the knees and hips at the same time. You could over extend and pull a muscle\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 20. Shifting forward way too much, learn to sit back, perhaps on a box.  As many others have said, ditch the pad.  You need to brace (breathe in through nose, push stomach out, show us how fat you are) while under the bar as it is still on J-cups - this will be crucial in assuming you unrack the weight with stability.  Buy yourself some Chuck Taylor shoes :)\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 21. Form is good\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 22. Ditch them shoes boi. Only gonna hold you back. Driving through heels on shoes designed to cushion your heels leaves a lot of stability on the table, and a stable stance is the core of the squat. Just squat without shoes then put ‘em back on when you move on with your workout.\n",
      "Form looks pretty good, I would recommend practicing low bar squat and ditching that pad though. Looks like you might not be bracing as well as you could. Check out the Pillars of Squat video series on YouTube, especially the breathing and bracing video. They helped me out 50lbs more on the bar as a beginner almost overnight.\n",

Bigger risks of injury are not form related but often improper load / volume management . As long as your properly warming up @ lighter percentages and are resting adequately between sets your fine .

Arch ur feet and squeeze ur scaps together, gaze should be down and forwards to maintain a neutral neck, keep ur chest up while maintaining trunk flexion. personal preference but It can be very distracting to perform compound lifts in front of a mirror. overall looks good just tighten up the upper back so you’ll be able to support heavier loads.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 1. You’re missing depth by at least half a foot.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 2. Lose the pad, reduce the weight, and get lower. You have to feel the bar on your shoulders. The pad interferes with your ability to pull it down securely on your back. If depth is an issue, work on hip and ankle mobility. If you're hesitant to go lower because of the load, lower the amount, get lower, and develop the confidence. With spotter bars you're less likely to get crushed under the bar.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 3. Reduce the weight until you can hit proper depth. Get rid of the bar pad.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 4. 1. Flex your upper back to create a “shelf” where the bar will sit. Picture that you’re pinching a pencil with your back muscles and shrug your shoulders up a tiny bit to create the shelf with your trap muscles.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 5. Get under the bar and place it on the upper back shelf you have created. Do not un-rack the bar just yet.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 6. Now that the bar is resting on your traps, breathe so that your stomach expands outward to the front and sides. Hold this breath and contract your abs. This is called bracing.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 7. After you have a solid brace, un-rack the bar and take 3 steps out: the first step with your right or left foot to get out of the pins, the second with your opposite foot to match the position of your first step, and the third to adjust your feet so that your right and left foot are equal in distance.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 8. With your upper back still tight, relax your abdominal brace and breathe.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 9. Take a deep breath into your stomach and create another brace.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 10. Squat down, picturing that you are sitting down onto a chair with a controlled motion. Keep holding your brace through the entire motion.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 11. When you reach the bottom of the squat, push hard through your feet and drive your knees out to the side. As you come up, breathe out while still keeping your abs flexed. Don’t let your knees cave inward, as this will cause knee pain down the line.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 12. You are now done with the rep. Depending on how you feel, you can take a few breaths and rest with the bar still on your back for a bit before creating another brace, or you can quickly create another brace and go down for another squat.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 13. Rack the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips: \n",
      "\n",
      "In your walkout you take too many steps out, and you even took a step forward. Limiting yourself to three steps will conserve energy and keep you stable. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also see that you’re not creating an abdominal brace before the squat, make sure to do this as it will improve your strength, make you more stable, and reduce risk of injury. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you squat down, you’re not reaching a full or parallel squat, but rather a quarter to half squat. To fix this, try watching some videos on squat stance and find the right one for your body. Film your sets from the side to make sure the crease of your hip and your knee are in alignment for a parallel squat.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 14. Yep, a couple things. One, no offense, but you want to learn to hold the bar properly and not use a pad. You’re a solid dude, you don’t need the pad. Second, you want to take a consistent, solid walk-out. Typically 3 steps. Right foot back, left foot back, and right foot move to widen/ready your stance (the point is less movement and solid consistent movement). Third, you’re not going down low enough at least a couple inches high. Make sure to get at least parallel to the ground. Fourth, as stated above, socks for squat is scary. Get some $50 Chuck Taylor’s or splurge on more expense squat shoes.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 15. Do not work on your form with weight. Just with the bar, work it out. Good advice is here.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 16. Lose the pad and the weight is too much your you.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 17. I would take the socks off on hardwood, the socks could slip out and that would be catastrophic.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 18. Do you have knee issues?  \n",
      "You have almost no depth. These would qualify as bro squats, a lot of weight and a slight dip to say you've done a \"rep\" to your friends.  \n",
      "You'll get much more by lowering the weight until you can get ALL the way down.  \n",
      "All the research on hypertrophy points towards the stretch being where all the gains are.  \n",
      "The stretch in a squat is the lower position. And most people with no knee issues, should be able to get down so the butt touches the calf muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go down slow, lowering should take roughly 2-4 seconds, faster and you're just letting gravity do the work in the area were you want to be doing the most work. And as controlled as possible, don't relax or \"drop\" at the end, but take a slight break at the lowest position still under tension.   \n",
      "Don't bounce on your calfs even if it feels like it helps you (that's an easy way to over stress tendons and get injuries), it's again better to reduce your weight until it is no longer necessary.  \n",
      "If you have issues going deep enough because of your ankles, standing your heels on something (or getting squat shoes) might help you gain that extra depth.\n",

Go lower, If you need, Put weights (5lb plates should do) under your heels to increase heel height to help with getting depth. No need for a pad, You're good, I'd argue gloves too but I'll let it slide hahaha, And your walkout should be only 3 steps, back, the third step used to spread to a comfortable stance.\n",

Just keep at it. The negative impact of imbalances are totally overhyped. The human body isn't perfectly symmetrical anyway.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 2. I wanted to vent out something that happened to me today at gym. I know it's not related to the post, but I am feeling extremely sad. So venting this out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Background: I am currently in month 3 of Wendler's 5/3/1 3 months challenge. I have been into strength training from less than a year or so. My goal is not even muscle building, but mostly strength and so, I am kind of bulky and sitting at \\~20% BF. \n",
      "\n",
      "Incident: Today, squats was the main lift, and deadlift was accesories. 10 reps@140 kg (70% RM month 3). So, I was deadlifting and I slammed the weights a bit. Not even that hard, but just a bit. The gym owner came to me and told me not to slam weights, to which I replied  didn't even slammed that hard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then he started body shaming me. He told that you shouldn't do this many sets of compound movements. (Mind you, I did 5 sets of 10 reps). He taunted me by saying, where are your muscles, you look like shit. You got no muscles but still want to slam weights. He asked me, what is the main muscle worked in deadlift, and I replied Hamstrings to which he started laughing. I told I am confident and showed him the google results. He wasn't ready to listen to me and told it worked lower back. No hamstrings involvement in deadlift. He started saying that I should study more about muscles before doing anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "I literally got body shamed. Gym is Indian version of Planet Fitness. No-one performs any compound movements, but just cardio and shit. I will change the gym from tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Felt like shit today. It sucks.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 3. You don't appear centered before you start, which may help contribute to the shift. From this angle, your shoulder position  also varies L to R--L looks more shrugged. I'd be willing to bet you have a fairly substantial differential in your hip rotation ability side to side, too. All correctable, but each needs some focus to correct.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 4. Your head is pretty off center so that’ll throw things off. It looks like you unrack with your lower back as opposed to your hips. Your right leg probably lacks internal rotation and it’s leading to your left scapula being unstable.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 5. I had the same exact shift issue where i went more to one side. People told me it was weak this or that or I need to do this exercise or that but none of it worked. Turns out one of my legs is 12mm shorter than the other. I got the shorter leg’s shoe shimmed with 10mm of material and now my squats perfect. Could measure it with a friend or at a chiropractor since they could probably get you a better measure\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 6. Put this at the top. This is the right answer.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 7. My god that is the dumbest thing I've heard. Please don't feel ashamed, feel smart and superior to that all muscle no brain owner, coz I would have been laughing internally if I heard that. \n",
      "\n",
      "The deadlift is, as the owner himself told, a COMPOUND movement. It works multiple muscle groups, where the hams, glutes, some lower back, some quads, lats and abs(for stability) are worked together. The main muscle would be glutes and then hams, because a good part of the movement is basically a standing hip thrust. \n",
      "\n",
      "And if you perform a movement with proper technique, you don't need to memorize each muscle group like it's coming in some exam lmao, basics are enough. Ask that owner how does an 4 stroke internal combustion engine work, surely he would know that since he would know driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, 140kg is no joke, plus you LOOK strong. Any average gym goer can look shredded by just modifying their calorie intake, building strength and muscle requires one to constantly push themselves to the limit. Not trying to downplay shredded people, but appreciating dudes who keep pushing PRs. People tend to forget the value of the weight they're lifting due to constant exposure to others lifting twice the amount on social media or IRL. 140 kg is like 2 average dudes, an average motorcycle, or like a fuckton of groceries. When you look at it like that you're impressive as fuck, who has barely reached half his full potential. Stay strong, keep lifting, and remember, train to reach your best version, not some randos version.\n",

      "Oh yeah try not to extend your lower back too much, think of keeping your glutes engaged, abs and lats tight and you're good to go.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 9. Well that guy is a proper dickhead. I’m glad you’ll find somewhere else to train!\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 10. You are correct. I do have a lot of hip rotation issues. While squatting and deadlifting, right leg is more duck-legged, staring out at 45%. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know it's stupid to ask, but can you suggest ways to correct? \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know about shoulders. I have a 1RM of 80kg on overhead press. What can be improved according to you if one looked more shrugged? I have extremely weak rear delts, I know that and I am working on that by rear delt flyes, face-pulls and shrugs. \n",

      "Regarding glutes involvement, do you mean I should be more upright? The thing is, if you see my rack, I can't stand properly when pulling the weight out of rack. It's slanted grooves. So, can't lift the weight while standing straight. Also, which exercise would you suggest for improving glute engagement? I have learnt from reddit that you have to squeeze your glutes like clinching, but I can't maintain that throughout the lift. Can you please suggest ways to improve that? \n",
      "\n",
      "I would also like to know more about 'extending lower back much?' Are you talking about butt wink? Sorry for asking stupid questions, but I want to improve my squats for squatober. \n",

      "Thanks a lot once again. Have a nice day sir.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 12. Hit Squat U on YT. TONS of good content there. \n",
      "I'd look into rotation exercises and check your bench form on the shoulders. If your left IS as shrugged as it looks, it could be a sign of weakness in the rotator cuff and the trap taking too much load. Bench and OHP can each contribute to that, bench maybe more so. Do some unilateral work, nice and slow and controlled, and see what you see and feel. Rear flyes are good IF you have the right seat position, aren't blowing your chest out too much, and are attentive to whether one side dominates the movement. Again, I'd do unilateral for a while to get a clearer feel.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 13. I think I know what he means regarding the lower back - a better cue would be tucking your ribs like shown in a [squat university video](https://youtube.com/@SquatUniversity?si=GDyCoOsN6d8LF4kV) (unhelpfully, that's a link to the channel as I can't recall which bracing video it is in), because during a squat like that your glutes don't magically \"stop being engaged\" or whatever he's getting at.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fuck the gym owner. Sounds like a bruised ego and jealousy talking. You're shifting some serious iron for someone training just a few months. Keep doing as you're doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: [Found the video I was referring to](https://youtu.be/TRmayQcweUc?si=M7350r6YoFnOD13_) - though I'll caveat OP, IMO your lower back looks great, I think the dude above is in a bit of a blind-leading-blind scenario given just a couple weeks ago he was asking if it's OK to be leaning forward whilst doing a low bar squat...\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 14. You're right, I don't usually do low bar squat since I end up leaning a little forward, but what helped mitigate that was engaging my glutes and abs to basically pull my lower back and ribcage down to straighten my lower torso. And I had come across the engaging the glute advice while squatting in some videos so that solidified my conclusion lol. But I apologise if I'm misleading people here.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 15. That's my point buddy, you've got to lean forward more during a low bar squat (I'm referring to the typical person, the degree of lean depends on femur:torso ratio), to keep weight central over the feet. There is no need to mitigate it, so long as you're not sacrificing lower back with unwitting flexion at the bottom of the movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not knowing that isn't a criticism - we're all here to share pointers and learn, after all. But it IS a sign that you are not an accomplished squatter yet and perhaps shouldn't be giving pointers quite yet unless specifically asked or the OP is clearly making big mistakes. I have no idea what you mean by \"engaging glutes\" and using that as an \"improvement\" to a guy who squats more than either of us is a bit unhelpful. Hypocritical that I responded? Not particularly, i didnt address his form as if it needed improvement and as he asked more, I referenced a well-supported source that gave related information rather than giving anecdotal advice.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 1. Honestly for a high bar back squat that looks pretty good. There is some shifting in your lifts, you can see it when the weight moves from forefoot to heel and back, and how your hips start to come up first. It doesn't happen every rep, so if you said this was close to max weight for you, then it would be expected and I wouldn't worry about it. There is only two things I would change. \n",
      "\n",
      "First go deeper at the bottom of the squat. We don't need ass-to-grass but I like to see the hip crease clearly below the knees. Your depth is somewhat consistent but varies slightly between the three reps. You can always squat to a target, like a medicine ball, so you know you are hitting depth. Some people like to cut their squat depth short because we are all stronger in half squats, but strength over full range is always better for overall health. If going deeper really means you have to dial down the weight, you can always add chains or bands to add more weight at the top. It all depends on your personal goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second is a safety factor, unwrap the thumbs. You have bumper plates so hopefully you practice how to ditch the bar behind you by throwing your hips forward. Wrapping the thumb means you they might hook onto the bar when you ditch. Not important if you have a spotter or lifting in a rack, but solo with bumpers the last thing you want is to let the bar ride down your spine like a xylophone.\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 2. Wow, thank you for the long and thoughtful points\n",
      "Yes, I believe my depth has been going up and up, not to give as an excuse but apparently my meniscus is starting to deteriorate so now I will really have to deal with lesser weights, but it was something already noticeable\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 3. I have a legitimate question, I am new to lifting myself. I paused the video at his deepest position and am having a hard time understanding how it would be possible to get your hip crease below your knees without going ass to grass. Am I missing something?\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 5. Good question, the difference is OP could go 2 inches lower so they are clearly below parallel and still be well above ass-to-grass. Think of ATG as deep as you possibly can go, which for some people is literally touching the ground with their rump. When people start to go below parallel you see their hamstring compress against their calves but their butt still hasn't reached their heels yet. Believe it or not, everyone was born with that much natural flexibility, but over years of sitting in chairs we've lost that end range of motion. The human body is very much use-it or lose-it, and when you stop going to the far end ranges of motion of your joints, you stop being able too, hence the deeper you can squat the better for your longevity.\n",

      " Komentarz numer: 1. Form isn’t that bad you just aren’t strong. Being stuck at a weight for 3 sessions doesn’t mean there’s an automatic fix, means you need to do more work to actually improve your strength. I recommend more than 3 sets, slightly further from failure and if you’re going to do heavy triples I’d add some back downs at at least 5 reps as well. You need more practice and more muscle\n",
      " Komentarz numer: 2. Form is fine, there's no substantial breakdown. You just need the muscle to move the weight. If you do this rep scheme often, you may not be able to recover properly (assuming your diet and resting are dialed in). Dial back the intensity, add some volume. I would target more RPE 7-8 than 9 for 5 sets of 5 for a few weeks, then decrease the number of sets/reps and increase the intensity over the next few weeks. See if that provides adequate volume and recovery.\n",

As for what’s sufficient, the volume threshold is going to change so you’ll have to play around with it but what you said seems like a fine starting point.  I don’t think you need to touch rpe 9 quite yet though. I would work up to heavy 3 and below at least once a week but no more than 2-3 sets of that, with the bulk of your  volume coming from the 5+ range at rpe 6-8. And I would squat twice a week, however you want to split that up. Maybe pause one day regular the other, high bar low bar, front squat back squat etc. And I would make sure you’re hitting your single leg work. And a machine probably wouldn’t hurt, maybe a leg press. I would prioritize volume, frequency and a wide range of reps. And gain some weight\n",

This article is in reference to someone making it into the hole and their hips shoot up on the ascent. but that's not what's going on here.\\n\\nWhat's going on here is that his quads are managing the lions share of the load. His knees are inward, which mean that his adductors can't maintain position. Closing in his knees also restricts movement of the pelvic floor. because of his weak adductors, he can't get his hips to sit in the hole, but the hole is where the glutes take over the lions share of the movement.\\n\\nHis body understands still that it needs to get deeper, so in order to compensate for the inability and lack of access tot he hole of his squat, he compensates by leaning forward to cover the difference in depth discrepancy. It's like a poor attempt to incorporate gluten into the lift. But it doesn't work.\\n\\nHowever, if he worked on his abductor/ adductor strength, he would be able to maintain an open knee position which would allow his pelvis room to stretch his glutes and engage them in the lift.

      "Any input on my form? I hurt my back doing squats right when I started lifting so have been kind of hesitant about getting back into them. Am I sticking my butt out to much? My feet naturally point out like that so it is a neutral stance for me. I was doing my last set of 5/3/1 for this recording but after watching I tried a few different things doing my 5x10 sets. I tried to drop my butt instead of sticking it out so much and also tried pointing my toes forward. Both left more of a feel in my quads which I normally don’t get. I get little to no feel in my back regardless\n",

Looks like you could be. You'll know if you're getting a low back pump in longer sets and it will contribute to low back fatigue.\", 'You’re low-bar squatting but with a high bar position. With the bar that high up on your shoulders you need to keep your upper body much more upright to keep your center of gravity balanced over the middle of your foot. Which tends to cause more knee bend and knees more forward / butt less back. \\nTry lowering the barbell into a low bar position where it sits on the bridge of your shoulder blades, between traps and lats. Will be easier to keep balanced over midfoot as you sit back and put your belly between your legs until your hip crease is parallel to your knee (femur parallel to the ground.)', 'Damn haven’t heard these songs in years what’s the playlist?', 'Ok thanks!
