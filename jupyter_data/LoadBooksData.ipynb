Barbells  permit the  minute  adjustments  during the \\nmovement that allow  individual  anthropometry  to  be  expressed. \\n\\nFurthermore,  barbells  require the  individual  to  make  these  adjustments,  and  any  other ones \\nthat might  be  necessary  to  retain  control  over the  movement  of the weight.  This  aspect of exercise \\ncannot  be  overstated  -  the  control  of the  bar,  and  the  balance  and  coordination  demanded  of the \\ntrainee,  are  unique  to  barbell  exercise  and  completely  absent  in  machine-based  training.  Since \\nevery  aspect  of  the  movement  of  the  load  is  controlled  by  the  trainee,  every  aspect  of  that \\nmovement is  being trained. \\n\\nThere  are  other  benefits  as  well.  All  of the  exercises  described  in  this  book involve varying \\ndegrees  of skeletal  loading.  After  all,  the  bones  are  what  ultimately  support  the  weight  on  the  bar. \\nBone is  living,  stress-responsive  tissue,  just like muscle, ligament,  tendon,  skin, nerve, and brain.  It \\nadapts  to  stress  just  like  any  other  tissue,  and  becomes  denser  and  harder  in  response  to  heavier \\nweight  This  aspect  of barbell  training is  very  important  to  older  trainees  and women, whose  bone \\ndensity  is  a  major  factor in  continued  health. \\n\\nAnd  barbells  are  very  economical  to  use. \\n\\nIn  practical  terms,  five  or  six  very  functional \\nweight  rooms  -  in  which  can  be  done  literally  hundreds  of different  exercises  -  can  be  built  for the \\ncost  of one  circuit  of  any  brand  of  modern  exercise  machine.  Even  if  cost  is  not  a  factor,  utility \\nshould  be.  In  an  institutional  situation,  the  number  of people  training  at  a  given  time  per  dollar \\nspent  equipping  them  might  be  an  important  consideration  in  deciding  which  type  of equipment \\nto  buy.
